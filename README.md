# hci-assignment2

This app allows students to login to the app or create an account if they don’t already have one, then they are directed to the home screen, where they have a list of courses they’re currently taking. They can click on one of the courses, and it will take them to the course screen, which shows them the full name of the course, the course code, and the course description. They also have the option to view the list of course assignments from here, or even go directly to the online chat, where the user can either privately message students from their class, or post something in the course group chat for everyone to see. The app also has a navigation bar at the bottom for the main screens, the first being the home page (list of courses), the second being the assignments list, and last one being the message chat.

Desirable functions to have for the future:
- Help page – to show users how to perform certain tasks in the app if they are unsure of something.
- Language support – to help users translate the app to their language (ex. French, Spanish, German) if they’re not fluent in English (international support for languages).
- Progress report for courses (user progress) – To show users their progress in the course (how much they’ve completed, like 66% for example).
- Support/Contact page – To allow users to submit a request for help if they’re having trouble with something.
- Notifications – To notify users about updates in the course, such as a new assignment being added to the course outline, or a new course being added to a list of the user’s current courses.
